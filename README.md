# **Data Visualization Projects**

**This was developed as part of the Data visualization course at the Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague (FIT ÄŒVUT).**


This repository contains three distinct data visualization projects that explore different datasets and provide insightful visual representations.

1. Animal Shelter Data Visualization
   
*Description:*

This project visualizes data related to an animal shelter. It includes analysis of adoption rates, animal types, and shelter performance metrics. Interactive visualizations help explore key factors influencing adoption trends.

*Key Features:*

- Visualize adoption trends over time.
- Compare adoption rates across animal types (e.g., dogs, cats).
- Analyze shelter performance based on different factors.

  
2. Public Transport: Tram Stops in Prague

*Description:*

This project focuses on visualizing public transportation data, specifically tram stops in Prague. It includes geographic visualizations of tram routes and stop locations.

*Key Features:*

- Map-based visualization of tram stop locations in Prague.
- Visualize tram routes between stops.
- Use of interactive maps to explore transportation networks.

  
3. Machine Learning Project: Life Expectancy Estimation
   
*Description:*
This project visualizes the results of a machine learning model used to estimate life expectancy across different countries. Visualizations explore factors that affect life expectancy and how well the model performs.

*Key Features:*

- Visualize predicted vs. actual life expectancy by country.
- Explore correlations between socio-economic and health factors and life expectancy.
- Display model performance metrics such as accuracy and error distribution.
